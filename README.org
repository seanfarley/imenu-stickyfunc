* imenu-stickyfunc

This package is mostly an academic exercise to make a hybrid of
=which-function-mode= and =semantic-stickyfunc-enhance=. I like the format of
=semantic-stickymode-enhance= but the speed is horrid. So, this package tried
to build the same thing but using =imenu= instead.

Due to how =imenu= stores data (it only stores the start of a function not the
end) this package is, at best, a guess.

* Installation and Usage

To install manually, put this file in your =load-path=, =(require
'imenu-stickyfunc)= in your init file, and run =imenu-stickyfunc=.

* License

GPLv3 or any later version.
